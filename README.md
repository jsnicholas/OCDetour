## Description

OCDetour is an app to help delay compulsions for people with OCD. Leveraging [research published in the journal of Behavioral Analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6758933/), OCDetour utilizes the concept of delay discounting. By delaying a compulsion, the _perceived reward value_ of completing the compulsion decreases. With OCDetour, the user can select from a list of Detours -- activities that encourage the user to do something else for a set amount of time -- and delay compulsions.

This application uses the following technologies:

React Library
**Mongoose** for data housing.
**Apollo/GraphQL** for remote data management.
**JWT** for authentication and security.
**Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI** for design.
